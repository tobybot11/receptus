# Introduction #

I have a love/hate relationship with receipts. I know they contain important information that can help me. So I keep them. All of them. Unfortunately, they are hard to deal with en masse.

This tool is my answer to this problem. I will automate personal receipt management if it is the last thing I do.

Down with paper receipts!
